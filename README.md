This is a helper directory to get you started on building your sites. This project
uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/documentation/components/menu/) which is a CSS only
framework **NO JavaScript**. Using Bulma will unlock a lot of styling out of the box
to help create your layouts, style components and provide a ton of sample code
to reference as a starting point in completing your projects. One big advantage
of using Bulma is that it will help you in creating responsive sites. Making your
site is not required for this course but this framework makes it incredibly easy
to achieve.

The structure of this project is already done for you with all the required `.html` pages
included. It will be up to you to put in your content and create your own sites.
Sample pages are provided as just that, samples. We have discussed much of what you will
need to complete the rest of your site.

For those wanting functionality beyond what is provided by HTML and CSS, included
in this projects is various Javascript plugins and jQuery. These plugins are set up in 
`/optional-plugins`. It is up to you to reverse engineer these plugins
and integrate them into your project.

**Using this project is entirely optional but highly recommended**
